# DSC_AndroidTask
This is the submission for Task given for Developer student club Recruitement for Android.

Though it is incomplete as i am just a beginner in android, this app includes following features : 
1. App icon (default set to android icon, changed it).
2. Splash screen as welcome screen when we open the app.
3. Login activity which allows to enter the next activity only if we enter the correct username and password (username = "admin", password = "admin").
4. Only 3 chances are given to login which are shown by "No of chances remaining : 3" view activity just below the login button. This count will decrease as long as we enter the wrong username or password. And the login button will be disabled as we enter wrong credentials 3 times or more.
5. After the succesfull login, the next activity contains list of tree names. We can scroll this list view up and down.
6. Then we have a menu resource to craete the menu, with "Logout" and "Hindi" buttons added in the menu to logout from the app and change the language but they are not working right now...

Working further on this will commit it when completed.
